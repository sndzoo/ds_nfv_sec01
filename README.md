## How to fetch the dataset?

This repository uses [DVC.org](https://dvc.org/), an open-source version control system for machine learning projects, to version the data blobs contained in the data set. You need to install [DVC](https://dvc.org/) to fetch the full data set, which is hosted by Amazon S3.

To fetch the full dataset follow these steps:

```sh
# 1. install DVC (https://dvc.org/), for example:
pip install dvc
# 2. clone this repository
git clone <https://github.com/<path-to-this-repo>
# 3. swtich into the cloned directory
cd <path-to-this-repo>
# 4. fetch the full data sets (this can take some time)
dvc pull
```

You find the actual data blobs, e.g., CSV files, inside `data/`.
